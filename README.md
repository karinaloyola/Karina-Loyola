# Hi everybody!

I am a Web Front-end developer, studying a Postgraduate course in “Web and Mobile Technologies and Development”.

With more than 10 years working in the corporate market in the projects area, I found myself very enthusiastic about web development, especially front-end. So this year I decided to make this my main professional area.
